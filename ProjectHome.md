## Why this project ? ##

In many projects, I needed to draw arrows or links between widgets. I found two projects :<br /><br />
**gwt-diagrams : http://code.google.com/p/gwt-diagrams/**<br />
**gwt-connectors : http://code.google.com/p/gwt-connectors/**<br />
<br />
Both didn't work as expected. So, I've to start my own project. Bugs or suggestions are welcome ;)
